# Sosamba [![Build status][azp badge]][azp]
A Discord framework based on Eris library, currently in an alpha stage.

## Projects using Sosamba
[Just look at them](https://github.com/topics/sosamba). To add your own, simply add the `sosamba` topic to your repository!

## How to use Sosamba
You can look at the documentation [here][docs], or look at [tt.bot](https://github.com/tt-bot-dev/tt.bot) (currently on the `v4-wip` branch).

## What does Sosamba aim to do?
Many things. Most of them are tt.bot's features, however improved in order to be efficient. The main one though, is to use as least production dependencies as possible.

Currently, you can do these things:

- Commands with an extendable context
- Event listeners
- Reaction menus
- Custom argument parsers to suit your needs

There will be likely more features included than that, though.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js], v10 and higher. We already use some advanced features that Node v8 does not support.
- [Eris]
